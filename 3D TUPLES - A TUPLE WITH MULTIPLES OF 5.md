## TUPLES - CHECK ELEMENTS IN TUPLE

### AIM  
To Write a Python program to check whether an element  52 and 12 are there in the tuple
### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Use eval() to get the tuple t from the user.
3. Check if the string '52' is present in the tuple t, and print the result (True or False).
4. Check if either the string '12' or the integer 12 is present in the tuple t, and print the result (True or False)
5. Terminate the program.
### PROGRAM
```
t=eval(input())
print('52' in t)
print('12' in t or 12 in t)
```
